# Python Classes/Objects
# Python is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.



# Simple method to initialise the class
class MyClass:
  x = 5
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)



# Standard form to  create the class
# To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
# All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1.name)
# Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
print(p1) # <__main__.Person object at 0x15039e602100
 




# The __str__() Function
# The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
# If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"
p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1)  #John(36) return a string not object


# The self Parameter
# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
# It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:



#object method
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)
p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()



# se the words mysillyobject and abc instead of self:
class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age

  def myfunc(abc):
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()

# Set the age of p1 to 40:
p1.age = 40

# Delete the age property from the p1 object:
del p1.age

# Delete the p1 object:
del p1



# The pass Statement
# class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
# Example
class Person:
  pass
